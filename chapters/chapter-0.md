# Chapter 0 - Introduction

The main resource used to write this book was the [ECMAScript specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/), which is the specification that JavaScript adheres to. It describes in detail how the language should behave. As a learning resource, it's fantastic, although very dense and long (around 1300 pages). I spent a lot of time studying the specification and decided to write a shorter, more intuitive resource. Since I didn't have time to do this for the entire language, I picked the most interesting part to me, objects. 

## Prerequisites

I like to think of this book as a resource that can prepare you for reading the EcmaScript specification yourself. Meaning, I try not to use too much abstraction. That being said, I don't think you need to be an advanced JavaScript programmer to understand it. Beginner/intermediate JavaScript programmers should be able to follow along just fine.

This book won't go deeply into the syntax of objects. If you want to brush up on that, I recommend reading https://javascript.info/object.

## Reading sequence

You will get the most value out of this book by reading it chronologically. Most chapters depend on the chapters before them. Despite that, it shouldn't be too confusing to jump into a random chapter as long as you have a basic understanding of the subjects covered before it.

## Conventions used

The following typographical conventions are used:

- *Italics* is used for new terms and emphasis.
- `Constant width` indicates a piece of code. 

Additionally, longer code examples are contained in code blocks such as:

```js
function doSomething() {
    // empty
}
```

Things of note will be presented like this:

> üí° This is an idea block. It will contain extra useful information that isn't necessarily part of the main text.
> 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a warning block. It will contain information that prevents you from making mistakes.
> 

## Footnotes

Footnotes are sprinkled throughout this book. It is not required to read these. They often link to external resources or note things of little significance to most readers.

Many footnotes link to places in the ECMAScript specification. I encourage you to try exploring these if it interests you.
